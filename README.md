This is GiannisN5's github repository created for an academic exerceise

So whatever you wtight at the README.md file appears here, cool. It wasn't mandatory to puta anything here but I did it anyway.
I don't know why Im writting this. Do can stop reading now. Have a nice day.


















































Im sorry, what are you doing here?
I mean, this is the end. There is no reason to continue reading.
Why are you still reading this? Don't you have anything beter to do? 
I can tell you some things to do. Go outside, touch some grass, meet new people.
Even if you don't like outside, at least do something productive, learn a new skill, maybe call a long lost friend.
You know what, now that I think about it YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT and it will be orders of magnitude better than reading this.
You are never gonna get back the time you wasted on this
Why did you even bothered scrolling down here?
And you know you won't get anything in the end. Its a text! A text someone wrote to waste someone's time.
And that someone happend to be you. I didn't expect that. Congrats! You made me accomplish my goal of wasting your time!
I almost feel bad that there is no reward for you. I really wish I could give you something, but as a text file, I can't do more than changing the colors of some pixels on your screen
If you ever find me, tell the the word "Tsigeli" and I will understand.
That's the end, for real. Thank you for staying along. Your time was much appreciated
