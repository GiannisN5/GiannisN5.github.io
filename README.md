This is GiannisN5's github repository created for an academic exerceise

Im sorry, what are you doing here?
I mean, this file had nothing to do with the exercise
Like, why did you even bothered opening it and why are you still reading this?
Don't you have anything beter to do? 
I can tell you some things to do. Go outside, touch some grass, meet new people.
Even if you don't like outside, at least do something productive, learn a new skill, maybe call a long lost friend.
You know what, now that I think about it YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT and it will be orders of magnitude beter than reading this
You are never gonna get back the time you wasted on this
And you know you won't get anything in the end. Its a text! A text someone wrote to maybe waste someone's time.
And that someone happend to be you. I didn't expect that. Congrats! You made me accomplish my goal of getting your attention.
I almost feel bad that there is no reward for you. I really wish I could give you something, but as a text file, I can't do more than changing the colors of some pixels on your screen
If you ever find me, tell the the word "Tsigeli" and I will understand.
That's the end, for real. Thank you for staying along. Your time was much appreciated
